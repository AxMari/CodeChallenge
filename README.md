# CodeChallenge

Simple project built with angular JS. relies on gulp and browser-sync, with jshint for my own proofreading and debugging

Installation

You'll need nodeJS. From there:

Clone the project and run npm start in your terminal

Once the dependencies are downloaded, you're all set. Run gulp and enjoy the show!
